Topic: Password Managers, strengths and vulnerabilities.

In our presentation, we will look at forms of encryption used by most popular password managers,
their strengths and vulnerabilities as services. We will address why password managers are an important
tool for every user but will also present some tradeoffs and possible vulnerabilities.

We will code the login page of  a fictional password manager that takes a user to their
vault of usernames and passwords. The vault will be organized by categories.
We plan on using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the coding part.
